    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=A8:4B:90:E5:31:FF:C2:46:00:75:5F:27:39:B7:56:56:17:EF:29:8E%3Bcom.wyattriley.hellomaps

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    A8:4B:90:E5:31:FF:C2:46:00:75:5F:27:39:B7:56:56:17:EF:29:8E;com.wyattriley.hellomaps

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
    -->
    <string name="google_maps_key" translatable="false" templateMergeStrategy="preserve">
        YOUR_KEY_HERE
    </string>
